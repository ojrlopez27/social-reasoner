I am proud of being able to represent my Chinese clients effectively against other sovereign governments in a bilingual capacity, leveraging upon legal expertise to advise on strategic issues, which also requires quick adaptation to new markets, cross cultural communication and building relationships from scratch. I am also passionate about using mainstream finance as a tool for addressing international development issues. Throughout my legal career, I have dedicated substantial amounts of time advising pro bono non-governmental organisations, non-profits and charities on financing and other commercial issues, accompanied by field experience in Africa, South Asia and South America. I think it is essential to use one\u0027s professional skills in a way which may benefit society as a whole. In 2014, I advised pro bono the Dolma Development Fund, Nepal\u0027s first private equity fund committed to investing in SMEs in Nepal, on regulatory and investment issues, spending 2 weeks on the ground.

I think it is essential to use one\u0027s professional skills in a way which may benefit society as a whole.

I am proud of being able to represent my Chinese clients effectively against other sovereign governments in a bilingual capacity, leveraging upon legal expertise to advise on strategic issues, which also requires quick adaptation to new markets, cross cultural communication and building relationships from scratch. I am also passionate about using mainstream finance as a tool for addressing international development issues. Throughout my legal career, I have dedicated substantial amounts of time advising pro bono non-governmental organisations, non-profits and charities on financing and other commercial issues, accompanied by field experience in Africa, South Asia and South America. I think it is essential to use one\u0027s professional skills in a way which may benefit society as a whole. In 2014, I advised pro bono the Dolma Development Fund, Nepal\u0027s first private equity fund committed to investing in SMEs in Nepal, on regulatory and investment issues, spending 2 weeks on the ground.

I am proud of being able to represent my Chinese clients effectively against other sovereign governments in a bilingual capacity, leveraging upon legal expertise to advise on strategic issues, which also requires quick adaptation to new markets, cross cultural communication and building relationships from scratch. I am also passionate about using mainstream finance as a tool for addressing international development issues. Throughout my legal career, I have dedicated substantial amounts of time advising pro bono non-governmental organisations, non-profits and charities on financing and other commercial issues, accompanied by field experience in Africa, South Asia and South America. I think it is essential to use one\u0027s professional skills in a way which may benefit society as a whole. In 2014, I advised pro bono the Dolma Development Fund, Nepal\u0027s first private equity fund committed to investing in SMEs in Nepal, on regulatory and investment issues, spending 2 weeks on the ground.

I think it is essential to use one\u0027s professional skills in a way which may benefit society as a whole.

I am proud of being able to represent my Chinese clients effectively against other sovereign governments in a bilingual capacity, leveraging upon legal expertise to advise on strategic issues, which also requires quick adaptation to new markets, cross cultural communication and building relationships from scratch. I am also passionate about using mainstream finance as a tool for addressing international development issues. Throughout my legal career, I have dedicated substantial amounts of time advising pro bono non-governmental organisations, non-profits and charities on financing and other commercial issues, accompanied by field experience in Africa, South Asia and South America. I think it is essential to use one\u0027s professional skills in a way which may benefit society as a whole. In 2014, I advised pro bono the Dolma Development Fund, Nepal\u0027s first private equity fund committed to investing in SMEs in Nepal, on regulatory and investment issues, spending 2 weeks on the ground.
